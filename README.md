# av-snapshot
This is a fork of Cheesecookie's cc_snapshot, and works pretty much the same way 
cc_snapshot does:
* Upload a snapshot of your character's profile
* Show off your character to your friends
* ???
* Profit!

## Installation

Run this command in the graphical CLI:
```
git checkout https://github.com/m-e-meyer/av-snapshot main
```
Will require [a recent build of KoLMafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

## Usage

Just enter `av-snapshot` into the gCLI.  It will gather and upload your information, and then tell you where you can visit your profile, a URL like `https://api.aventuristo.net/av-snapshot?u=<username>`.

## Notes
Sorry, you can't access cc_snapshot's stored profiles directly from api.aventuristo.net.  av-snapshot's backend was built from scratch, and uses a new database.  Web pages generated by av-snapshot have links to the cc_snapshot equivalent, though.
